/*	ID selectors (By.ID – Matches by @id attribute)
	IDs are the safest, fastest locator option and should always be your first choice
	IDs should be unique in every page according to W3C website
	even if the DOM changes, if the ID is still there, then WebDriver can still locate it
	always try and get extra IDs added into the code, this makes testers life easier
	fastest locator as it uses the document.getElementById() javascript command which is optimised by many browsers
